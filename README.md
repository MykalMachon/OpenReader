# OpenReader

![](https://github.com/mykalmachon/openreader/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

an open source multi-modal lightweight e-reader software. 

## Goals and inspiration

I'm _functionally_ a huge fan of my Kindle Paprewhite. That said, my Kindle, and most other e-readers on the market, are heavily locked down with DRM and limited features. 
They're great devices and they work great within their ecossytems, but what happens when Amazon drops support for your Kindle? or you want to add a book format that the device doesn't support? you're kind of just stuck.

My hope is to create an open-source reader system that allows you the freedom to read on any device (web, cli, and eventually custom hardware) and tweak the software as you see fit. 
As with all of my projects, I also hope to learn more about golang (this project's primary language) and open book file standards like EPUB.
